I'm a digital immigrant, can remember the day my school opened it's first computer lab. To understand me, you must first understand the background of the two beautiful human beings that brought me into this world.</p><br>                 <p>My mother, Loretta, comes from a hardworking Italian-American family. A family to where almost all the men became construction workers.  It is fairly safe to say that my mother's side is of mechanically inclined people. My father's side is comprised of almost all art-oriented people. My father passed away when I was 8 years old. He was a published poet. My grand mom is still living at 93, an author, and has two books currently for sale on Amazon. My uncle has been working on Broadway for almost 40 years. My Aunt is a theatrical actress, director, and a columnist for a theatrical weblog.</p><br>                <p>I can actually fully understand why it remains my ongoing passion to become a web developer. My brain is ingrained with this awesome natural marriage of an art meets mechanical mindset. It's just naturally gravitates towards technological art. Web development is my calling.</p><br>                 <p>Even though I currently work in healthcare, I know it is my destiny to become a web developer. I'll be the first to admit that I'm raw, and I need to be guided in certain areas. On the technical side, I need work so that I can understand how JavaScript works, PHP works, and so forth. Once, I do grasp it, look out, because I have a passion inside to unleash on this world. I am very envious of the professional individuals that have this skillset. I look up to them with respect, and want to develop that same knowledge they pocess.</p><br>        </div>    </article>    </section>	<!-- Blog, Components -->    <head>        <div class="vic_head_wrap">        	<h2 class="vic_h2_style" id="vic_blog_h2">                <img id="vic_blog_img" src="blog.png"><a href="#">Main CTA Component Blog</a>            </h2>        </div>    </head>    <section id="vic_blog_sect">	    <head>	        <div class="vic_art_wrap" id="main_comp_wrap">            <div class="vic_comp_wrap" id="vic_main_comp">                <h3 class="vic_h3_style" id="vic_comp_h3">                    <a href="#">Slider Component</a>                </h3>    </head>    <figure>        <img id="slider_pic" src="slider.png">    </figure>    <article>    <p>The Sider component is my main component of focus. I have always longed to possess the necessary skills to design such a beautiful component. I see the image slider as such an impactful tool to which adds an artistic element to the webpage. I think if used right, it has endless possibilities. You can enhance it by overlaying text and buttons integrated with animations to create a stunning effective presentation piece. It is the ideal CTA / Central focal point to every webpage it graces.</p><br>    <p>From both an easthetics and a technical standpoint, the image slider would be mainly comprised of JavaScript controlling the necessary actions to get the slider to perform it's magic. Sliders usaully have forward and back buttons to help the user toggle or scroll through images. They also are typically seen having a pinpoint/radio button like navigation structure to help the guide themsevles through each image of the slider.</p><br>    <p>As mentioned before, sliders can also consist of images mixed with descriptive text to ad to, or enhance each image in particular that's shown. <b>See Infograph Below:</b></p>    </article>            </div>    <figure>    	<img id="vic_decon_img" src="slide_decon.png">    </figure>        	    </section>    <section id="vic_comp_sect">	    <head>        <div class="vic_head_wrap">        	<h2 class="vic_h2_style" id="vic_comp_h2">                <img id="vic_comp_img" src="components.png"><a href="#">Components Blog</a>            </h2>        </div>    </head>            <div class="vic_art_wrap" id="comp_nav_wrap">            <div class="vic_comp_wrap" id="vic_2nd_comp">                <h3 class="vic_h3_style" id="vic_nav_h3">                    <a href="#">Navigation Component</a>                        <img id="nav_pic" src="navigation.png">                </h3>                <article id="nav_article">                 <p>The Navigation component is another component of focus. I also feel that it's a necessary skill to bring to the table a component like a drop-down navigation component. I really like a particular type of drow-down menu navigation system. One where the hover drop-down feature is comprised of pictures as well as links.</p><br>    <p>With a healthy mixture of HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills; I sure I'll be able to pull off this awesome task. I have a goal to bring my perfect drop-down navigation menu to a reality.</p>    </article>            </div>            <div class="vic_comp_wrap" id="vic_3rd_comp">                <h3 class="vic_h3_style" id="vic_form_h3">                    <a href="#">Forms Component</a>                        <img id="forms_pic" src="form.png">                </h3>                <article id="form_article">                 <p>The Form component is yet another component of importance to the continuity of a modern webpage. I would like my focus to be on the proper placement of various aspects of the form component. I hope to gain the skills to have total control over the layout of form elements such as input boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.</p><br>    <p>My key interest is to develop a harmony between label fields and all other accompanying input features.</p>    </article>            </div>            <div class="vic_comp_wrap" id="vic_4th_comp">                <h3 class="vic_h3_style" id="vic_maps_h3">                    <a href="#">Maps Component</a>                        <img id="maps_pic" src="map.png">                </h3>            </div>            <div class="vic_comp_wrap" id="vic_5th_comp">                <h3 class="vic_h3_style" id="vic_foot_h3">                    <a href="#">Footer Component</a>                        <img id="footer_pic" src="footer.png">                </h3>            </div>        </div>                </section>    <footer id="vic_foot">        <div id="vic_foot_wrap">            <img src="">            	<h3 id="vic_h3_style" id="vic_footer_h3">                                </h3>        </div>    </footer></div><script src="prefixfree.min.js"></script></body></html>
